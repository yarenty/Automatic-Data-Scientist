= MLaaS - Machine Learning API


== Intro
An API to enable creating and using machine learning models.


The URL uses link:https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis/blob/master/google/api/http.proto?[Google API HTTP annotation] syntax.

This service provides the following discovery document:
**https://{site}/$discovery/rest?version=v1**



**General flow:** +
Data => ADS => Model (repo) => Services (prediction/anomalies)

All on top of operations and types (policy)  



== DATASET

Represents a dataset.

A dataset can have multiple versions/increases, usually with time.

Full API: link:v1/datasets/index.html[v1/datasets] 


=== Methods
[cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
|name |type |url |description
|create
|POST |/v1/datasets
|Creates a new dataset.
|delete
|DELETE |/v1/datasets/{name=dataset/*}
|Deletes a dataset.
|get
|GET |/v1/datasets/{name=dataset/*}
|Gets information about a dataset, including its name, the description (if set), 
and the default version specification.
|list
|GET |/v1/datasets
|Lists the datasets in a project.
|patch
|PATCH |/v1/datasets/{name=dataset/*}
|Updates a specific dataset with new cached data.
|getSlices
|GET |/v1/datasets/{name=dataset/*}:getSlices
|Gets a dataset, with train/test/validation slices.
Slicing is depending on dataset and JSON parameters.
Default is:

- if dataset is time series: continuous, 60/20/20%

- if dataset is not times eries: random sampling, 80/10/10%.
|===





== ADS


Represents DataScientistFlow job, metamodel and actions on them.


Full API:  link:v1/ads/index.html[v1/ads]



=== Methods
[cols="1,1,2,5a"]
|===
|cancel
|POST |/v1/ads/{name=job/*}:cancel
|Cancels a running ADS training job.
|create
|POST |/v1/ads/jobs
|Creates a training ads job.
|get
|GET |/v1/ads/{name=jobs/*}
|Describes a ads job.
|list
|GET |/v1/ads/jobs
|Lists the adsd jobs in the project.
|===







== MODEL

Represents a machine learning solution.

A model can have multiple versions, each of which is a deployed, trained model ready to receive prediction requests.
 The model itself is just a container.

Full API  link:v1/models/index.html[v1/models]

=== Methods
[cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
|name |type |url |description
|create
|POST| /v1/models
|Creates a model which will later contain one or more versions.
|delete
|DELETE | /v1/models/{name=model/*}
|Deletes a model.
|get
| GET | /v1/models/{name=model/*}
|Gets information about a model, including its name, the description (if set),
 and the default version (if at least one version of the model has been deployed).

|list
|GET |/v1/models
|Lists the models in a project.
|patch
|PATCH |/v1/models/{name=model/*}
|Updates a specific model resource.


|getIamPolicy
|GET |v1/models/{name=model/*}:getIamPolicy
|Experimental. Gets the access control policy for a resource.
|setIamPolicy
|POST |v1/models/{name=model/*}:setIamPolicy
|Experimental. Sets the access control policy on the specified resource.
|testIamPermissions
|POST |/v1/model/{sname=model/*}:testIamPermissions
|Experimental. Returns permissions that a caller has on the specified resource.
|===




== MODEL.VERSION

Represents a version of the model.

Each version is a trained model deployed in the cloud, ready to handle prediction requests. 
A model can have multiple versions. You can get information about all of the versions of a given model by 
calling `v1.models.versions.list`.


Full API: link:v1/models/versions/index.html[v1/models/versions] 

=== Methods
[cols="1,1,2,5"]
|===
|name |type |url |description
|create
|POST |/v1/{models/*}/versions
|Creates a new version of a model from a trained TensorFlow model.
|delete
|DELETE | `+/v1/{models/*/versions/*}+`
|Deletes a model version.
|get
|GET |`+/v1/{models/*/versions/*}+`
|Gets information about a model version.
|list
|GET |/v1/{models/*}/versions
|Gets basic information about all the versions of a model.
|patch
|PATCH |/v1/{models/*/versions/*}
|Updates the specified Version resource.
|setDefault
|POST |t/v1/{models/*/versions/*}:setDefault
|Designates a version to be the default for the model.
|===






== SERVICE.PREDICTION

Represents anomaly job, and metadata.

Full API: link:v1/services/predictions/index.html[v1/services/predictions] 

=== Methods
[cols="1,1,2,5"]

|Cancels a running prediction job.
|create
|POST |/v1/serivces/predictions/{name=prediction/*}
|Creates a batch prediction job.
|get
|GET |/v1/services/predictions/{name=prediction/*}
|Describes a prediction job.
|list
|GET |/v1/services/predictions
|Lists the prediction jobs in the project.
|===

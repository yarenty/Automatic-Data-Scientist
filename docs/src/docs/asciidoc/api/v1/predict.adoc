= Predict Request Details

link:../index.html[back <<] 

The predict method performs prediction on the data in the request.

This page describes the format of the prediction request body and of the response body,
 as well as the URL format of the HTTP request. 


== Request body

The request body contains data with the following structure (JSON representation):
----
{
  "instances": [
    <value>|<simple/nested list>|<object>,
    ...
  ]
}
----

The instances[] object is required, and must contain the list of instances to get predictions for.

The structure of each element of the instances list is determined by your model's input definition. 
Instances can include named inputs (as objects) or can contain only unlabeled values.

Not all data includes named inputs. Some instances are simple JSON values (boolean, number, or string).
 However, instances are often lists of simple values, or complex nested lists.

Below are some examples of request bodies.

CSV data with each row encoded as a string value:

`+{"instances": ["1.0,true,\\"x\\"", "-2.0,false,\\"y\\""]}+`

Plain text:
----
{"instances": ["the quick brown fox", "la bruja le dio"]}
----


Sentences encoded as lists of words (vectors of strings):
----
{
  "instances": [
    ["the","quick","brown"],
    ["la","bruja","le"],
    ...
  ]
}
----
Floating point scalar values:
----
{"instances": [0.0, 1.1, 2.2]}
----

Vectors of integers:
----
{
  "instances": [
    [0, 1, 2],
    [3, 4, 5],
    ...
  ]
}
----

Tensors (in this case, two-dimensional tensors):
----
{
  "instances": [
    [
      [0, 1, 2],
      [3, 4, 5]
    ],
    ...
  ]
}
----

Images, which can be represented different ways. 
In this encoding scheme the first two dimensions represent the rows and columns of the image, 
and the third dimension contains lists (vectors) of the R, G, and B values for each pixel:
----
{
  "instances": [
    [
      [
        [138, 30, 66],
        [130, 20, 56],
        ...
      ],
      [
        [126, 38, 61],
        [122, 24, 57],
        ...
      ],
      ...
    ],
    ...
  ]
}
----

=== Data encoding
JSON strings must be encoded as UTF-8. To send binary data, you must base64-encode the data and mark it as binary. 
To mark a JSON string as binary, replace it with a JSON object with a single attribute named b64:
----
{"b64": "..."} 
----
The following example shows two serialized tf.Examples instances, requiring base64 encoding
 (fake data, for illustrative purposes only):
----
{"instances": [{"b64": "X5ad6u"}, {"b64": "IA9j4nx"}]}
----

The following example shows two JPEG image byte strings, requiring base64 encoding 
(fake data, for illustrative purposes only):
----
{"instances": [{"b64": "ASa8asdf"}, {"b64": "JLK7ljk3"}]}
----

=== Multiple input tensors
Some models have an underlying TensorFlow graph that accepts multiple input tensors. 
In this case, use the names of JSON name/value pairs to identify the input tensors, 
as shown in the following examples:

For a graph with input tensor aliases "tag" (string) and "image" (base64-encoded string):
----
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "tag": "beach",
      "image": {"b64": "ASa8asdf"}
    },
    {
      "tag": "car",
      "image": {"b64": "JLK7ljk3"}
    }
  ]
}
----

For a graph with input tensor aliases "tag" (string) and "image" (3-dimensional array of 8-bit ints):
----
{
  "instances": [
    {
      "tag": "beach",
      "image": [
        [
          [138, 30, 66],
          [130, 20, 56],
          ...
        ],
        [
          [126, 38, 61],
          [122, 24, 57],
          ...
        ],
        ...
      ]
    },
    {
      "tag": "car",
      "image": [
        [
          [255, 0, 102],
          [255, 0, 97],
          ...
        ],
        [
          [254, 1, 101],
          [254, 2, 93],
          ...
        ],
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
----

== Response body
Responses are very similar to requests.

If the call is successful, the response body contains one prediction entry per instance in the request body,
 given in the same order:
----
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      object
    }
  ]
}
----

If prediction fails for any instance, the response body contains no predictions. 
Instead, it contains a single error entry:
----
{
  "error": string
}
----
The predictions[] object contains the list of predictions, one for each instance in the request.

On error, the error string contains a message describing the problem. 
The error is returned instead of a prediction list if an error occurred while processing any instance.

Even though there is one prediction per instance, the format of a prediction is not directly 
related to the format of an instance. Predictions take whatever format is specified in the outputs 
collection defined in the model. The collection of predictions is returned in a JSON list. 
Each member of the list can be a simple value, a list, or a JSON object of any complexity. 
If your model has more than one output tensor, each prediction will be a JSON object containing 
a name/value pair for each output. The names identify the output aliases in the graph.

=== Response body examples
The following examples show some possible responses:

A simple set of predictions for three input instances, where each prediction is an integer value:
----
{"predictions": [5, 4, 3]}
----
A more complex set of predictions, each containing two named values that correspond to output tensors, named label and scores respectively. The value of label is the predicted category ("car" or "beach") and scores contains a list of probabilities for that instance across the possible categories.
----
{
  "predictions": [
    {
      "label": "beach",
      "scores": [0.1, 0.9]
    },
    {
      "label": "car",
      "scores": [0.75, 0.25]
    }
  ]
}
----
A response when there is an error processing an input instance:
----
{"error": "Divide by zero"}
----

== Machine Learnind as a Service

The MLaaS is an end-to-end platform that streamlines the entire process of building, deploying, and exposing ML models.  +
Data scientists and developers can launch turnkey compute environments for collaboratively training and deploying
predictive models and integrate those models into real-time smart applications. +



== Automatic Data Scientist

image:images/data-scientist.jpg?[ADS,200,200]

Easy use of collected data to answer questions, make links, find patterns and relationships. +
Dashboard analytics, data visualization, knowledge graphs and real time alerts! +
Initial focus is on time series data â€“ since it is widely used in our domain. +

Data intelligence platform to help people to understand data. There are a huge amount of technologies out there
to help you gather, store and cleanse data, but not a lot of intuitive technologies to allow you to understand it 
and ultimately investigate on that. +
 
 

 
== Machine Learning Service

Companies often build hundreds of models a day (e.g., churn, recommendation, credit default).
However, there is no practical way to manage all the models that are built over time. 
This lack of tooling leads to insights being lost, resources wasted on re-generating old results, and difficulty collaborating. +
 +

MLaaS is an end-to-end system that tracks models as they are built, extracts and stores relevant metadata 
(e.g., hyperparameters, data sources) for models, and makes this data available for easy querying and visualization. +

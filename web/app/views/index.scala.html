            The MLaaS is an end-to-end platform that streamlines the entire process of building, deploying, and exposing ML models.<br/>
            <br/>
            Data scientists and developers can launch turnkey compute environments for collaboratively training and deploying
            predictive models and integrate those models into real-time smart applications.<br/>

            Companies often build hundreds of models a day (e.g., churn, recommendation, credit default).
            However, there is no practical way to manage all the models that are built over time. 
            This lack of tooling leads to insights being lost, resources wasted on re-generating old results, and difficulty collaborating.<br/>
            <br/>
            MLaaS is an end-to-end system that tracks models as they are built, extracts and stores relevant metadata 
            (e.g., hyperparameters, data sources) for models, and makes this data available for easy querying and visualization.<br/>

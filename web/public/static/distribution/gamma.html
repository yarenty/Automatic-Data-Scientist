In probability theory and statistics, the gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. 
The exponential distribution, Erlang distribution, and chi-squared distribution are special cases of the gamma distribution.
 There are three different parametrizations in common use:With a shape parameter k and a scale parameter θ.<br>
<ul><li>With a shape parameter α = k and an inverse scale parameter β = 1/θ, called a rate parameter.</li>
    <li>With a shape parameter k and a mean parameter μ = k/β.</li>
    <li>In each of these three forms, both parameters are positive real numbers.</li></ul>
The gamma distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution (both with respect to a uniform base measure 
and with respect to a 1/x base measure) for a random variable X for which E[X] = kθ = α/β is fixed and greater than zero,
 and E[ln(X)] = ψ(k) + ln(θ) = ψ(α) − ln(β) is fixed (ψ is the digamma function).)

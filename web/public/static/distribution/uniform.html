n probability theory and statistics, the continuous uniform distribution or rectangular distribution is a family of
symmetric probability distributions such that for each member of the family, all intervals of the same length on
the distribution's support are equally probable. The support is defined by the two parameters, a and b,
which are its minimum and maximum values. The distribution is often abbreviated U(a,b).
It is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X under no constraint other than
that it is contained in the distribution's support.[

In probability theory and statistics, the logistic distribution is a continuous probability distribution.
Its cumulative distribution function is the logistic function, which appears in logistic regression and
feedforward neural networks. It resembles the normal distribution in shape but has heavier tails (higher kurtosis).

The Tukey lambda distribution can be considered a generalization of the logistic distribution since it adds a shape parameter, λ,
and corresponds to the logistic distribution when λ is zero.

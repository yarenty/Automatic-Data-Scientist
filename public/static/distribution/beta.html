In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions 
defined on the interval [0, 1] parametrized by two positive shape parameters, denoted by α and β, 
that appear as exponents of the random variable and control the shape of the distribution.<br/><br/>
The beta distribution has been applied to model the behavior of random variables limited to intervals of 
finite length in a wide variety of disciplines.<br/><br/>

In Bayesian inference, the beta distribution is the conjugate
 prior probability distribution for the Bernoulli, binomial, negative binomial and geometric distributions. 
For example, the beta distribution can be used in Bayesian analysis to describe initial knowledge concerning 
probability of success such as the probability that a space vehicle will successfully complete a specified mission. 
The beta distribution is a suitable model for the random behavior of percentages and proportions.<br/><br/>

The usual formulation of the beta distribution is also known as the beta distribution of the first kind, 
whereas beta distribution of the second kind is an alternative name for the beta prime distribution.

In probability theory and statistics, the Lévy distribution, named after Paul Lévy,
 is a continuous probability distribution for a non-negative random variable.
 In spectroscopy, this distribution, with frequency as the dependent variable,
 is known as a van der Waals profile. It is a special case of the inverse-gamma distribution.

It is one of the few distributions that are stable and that have probability density functions
that can be expressed analytically, the others being the normal distribution and the Cauchy distribution.

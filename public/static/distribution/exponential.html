In probability theory and statistics, the exponential distribution (also known as negative exponential distribution)
is the probability distribution that describes the time between events in a Poisson point process, i.e.,
a process in which events occur continuously and independently at a constant average rate. It is a particular case
of the gamma distribution. It is the continuous analogue of the geometric distribution, and it has the key property of being memoryless.
In addition to being used for the analysis of Poisson point processes it is found in various other contexts.

The exponential distribution is not the same as the class of exponential families of distributions, which is a large
class of probability distributions that includes the exponential distribution as one of its members,
but also includes the normal distribution, binomial distribution, gamma distribution, Poisson, and many others.

In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of
a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable X is log-normally distributed,
then Y = ln(X) has a normal distribution. Likewise, if Y has a normal distribution, then the exponential function of
Y, X = exp(Y), has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values.
The distribution is occasionally referred to as the Galton distribution or Galton's distribution, after Francis Galton.
The log-normal distribution also has been associated with other names, such as McAlister, Gibrat and Cobbâ€“Douglas.

A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables,
each of which is positive. This is justified by considering the central limit theorem in the log domain.
The log-normal distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate X for which the mean and variance of ln(X) are specified.

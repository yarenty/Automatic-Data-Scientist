In probability theory and statistics, the F-distribution, also known as Snedecor's F distribution or the Fisherâ€“Snedecor distribution
(after Ronald Fisher and George W. Snedecor) is a continuous probability distribution that arises frequently as
the null distribution of a test statistic, most notably in the analysis of variance (ANOVA), e.g., F-test.

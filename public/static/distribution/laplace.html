In probability theory and statistics, the Laplace distribution is a continuous probability distribution
named after Pierre-Simon Laplace. It is also sometimes called the double exponential distribution,
because it can be thought of as two exponential distributions (with an additional location parameter)
spliced together back-to-back, although the term is also sometimes used to refer to the Gumbel distribution.
The difference between two independent identically distributed exponential random variables is governed by a Laplace distribution,
as is a Brownian motion evaluated at an exponentially distributed random time.
Increments of Laplace motion or a variance gamma process evaluated over the time scale also have a Laplace distribution.
